            <h5> Reach more customers </h5>
                <p> 
                    Reach more customers interested in products like yours across Amazon, Twitch, and third-party sites and apps with Sponsored Display. 
                    With customizable creative elements and video formats, advertisers can showcase their brand and products through immersive storytelling. 
                </p>
                <p> There are many ways that reach can be an important factor in your advertising campaigns and marketing strategy. 
                    We're breaking down the basics here for advertisers of all levels. 
                </p>

            <h5> Build brand awareness </h5>
                <p> 
                    Use Sponsored Display video to make your product and brand story more memorable while customers are shopping or consuming the content they love. 
                    Use engaging content like tutorials and unboxing videos to help audiences better understand your product, and layer in first-party insights to reach relevant audiences.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Brand awareness is a customer's knowledge, perception, and familiarity with a brand. A customer's perception of a brand is based on a range of inputs over time. 
                    Companies build brands by delivering a consistent message and experience across touchpoints. That consistency, including the repetition of messaging and experience, 
                    is fundamental to making your brand memorable, which is key to building brand awareness.

            <h5> Increase traffic </h5>
                <p> Sponsored Brands can help customers discover your brand and products with creative ads that appear in relevant shopping results, and drive traffic to your fully 
                    branded Store. When brands talk about “increasing traffic,” they refer to customers who take an action online to visit a product page or some other resource 
                    that exists on a brand's site. Driving traffic can result from a call to action the brand has provided, ads that create intrigue or interest, or simply following a related link.
                </p>

            <h5> Increase sales and conversion </h5>
                <p>
                    A conversion is the point in the purchase journey when a customer purchases a product after deciding it is best-suited to them. 
                    Conversions are ultimately the end goal of most marketing campaigns, and impact a business's bottom line. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Help boost sales of individual products with a single click to conversion to take shoppers directly to your product detail page with Sponsored Products.
